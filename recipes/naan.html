    <h3>Ingredents</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>4 ½ cups bread flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic (Optional)</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1</li>
        <p>Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl. Let stand about 10 minutes, until frothy.</p>
        <li>Step 2</li>
        <p>Meanwhile, generously oil a large bowl.</p>
        <li>Step 3</li>
        <p>Stir sugar, milk, egg, and salt into the yeast mixture. Mix in enough flour to make a soft dough.</p>
        <li>Step 4</li>
        <p>Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth, 6 to 8 minutes.</p>
        <li>Step 5</li>
        <p>Place dough in the prepared oil, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
        </p>
        <li>Step 6</li>
        <p>Punch down dough on a lightly floured surface, and knead in garlic. Pinch off small handfuls of dough about
            the size of a golf ball; you should have about 14. Roll each piece into a ball and place on a tray. Cover
            with a towel, and allow to rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.</p>
        <li>Step 7</li>
        <p>Meanwhile, preheat a large grill pan over high heat.</p>
        <li>Step 8</li>
        <p>Roll each piece of dough into a thin circle. </p>
        <li>Step 9</li>
        <p>Brush some melted butter on the preheated grill pan. Place a few pieces of dough in the pan (as many as you
            can fit) and cook until puffy and lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Brush butter onto the uncooked sides,
            flip, and cook until browned, 2 to 4 more minutes. Remove from the grill and repeat to cook the remaining
            naan.</p>
    </ol>
